#About the Cash Machine exercise

Well, it was quite simple to write a couple of methods and cover almost all the tests. 

I tucked about 20 minuts to do that, but...

To cover a few broked tests I spend more time that I wished, stuck at a wrong approach. When I decided to review the approach was not hard to finish the test. I think the total coding time was something about four hours.

#About the Tests
I also wrote more tests , covering all the new methods. We got now 42 tests with 100% code coverage.


It was a nice exercise, I hope you like. I'll be waiting the answer.

Thanks
